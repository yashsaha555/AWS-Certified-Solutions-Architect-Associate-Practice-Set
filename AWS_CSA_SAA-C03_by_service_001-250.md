### Question #216

A company has a serverless website with millions of objects in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company uses the S3 bucket as the origin for an Amazon CloudFront distribution. The company did not set encryption on the S3 bucket before the objects were loaded. A solutions architect needs to enable encryption for all existing objects and for all objects that are added to the S3 bucket in the future. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST amount of effort?

- A. Create a new S3 bucket. Turn on the default encryption settings for the new S3 bucket. Download all existing objects to temporary local storage. Upload the objects to the new S3 bucket.

- B. Turn on the default encryption settings for the S3 bucket. Use the S3 Inventory feature to create a .csv file that lists the unencrypted objects. Run an S3 Batch Operations job that uses the copy command to encrypt those objects.

- C. Create a new encryption key by using AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS). Change the settings on the S3 bucket to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS managed encryption keys (SSE-KMS). Turn on versioning for the S3 bucket.

- D. Navigate to Amazon S3 in the AWS Management Console. Browse the S3 bucket’s objects. Sort by the encryption eld. Select each unencrypted object. Use the Modify button to apply default encryption settings to every unencrypted object in the S3 bucket.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Turn on default encryption, then use S3 Inventory + S3 Batch Operations self-copy to encrypt existing objects at scale.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Re‑bucket copy via local storage is unnecessary.
- C: Changing bucket to SSE‑KMS doesn’t encrypt existing objects by itself.
- D: Manual console edits don’t scale.

### Question #75

A company wants to move a multi-tiered application from on premises to the AWS Cloud to improve the application's performance. The application consists of application tiers that communicate with each other by way of RESTful services. Transactions are dropped when one tier becomes overloaded. A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues and modernizes the application. Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally ecient?

- A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services.

- B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.

- C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.

- D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Use SQS between EC2 tiers to decouple and buffer requests; scale with queue depth to prevent dropped transactions.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Full serverless refactor (API Gateway + Lambda) is larger change.
- B: Upsizing instances doesn’t address overload spikes and coupling.
- C: SNS is pub/sub, not a queue for backpressure and ordering.

### Question #87

A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the event. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.

- B. Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.

- C. Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.

- D. Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Queue customer events in SQS FIFO during DB upgrades; a separate Lambda polls the queue and writes when DB is available so no data is lost.

**Incorrect:**
- A: RDS Proxy helps with connection pooling but cannot accept writes during DB unavailability.
- B: Extending Lambda run time and retries still loses events when the DB is down.
- C: Lambda local storage is ephemeral and not durable.

### Question #94

A company is designing an application where users upload small files into Amazon S3. After a user uploads a file, the file requires one-time simple processing to transform the data and save the data in JSON format for later analysis. Each file must be processed as quickly as possible after it is uploaded. Demand will vary. On some days, users will upload a high number of files. On other days, users will upload a few files or no files. Which solution meets these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Configure Amazon EMR to read text files from Amazon S3. Run processing scripts to transform the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

- B. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use Amazon EC2 instances to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.

- C. Configure Amazon S3 to send an event notification to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function to read from the queue and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in Amazon DynamoDB.

- D. Configure Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) to send an event to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams when a new file is uploaded. Use an AWS Lambda function to consume the event from the stream and process the data. Store the resulting JSON file in an Amazon Aurora DB cluster.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** S3 events to SQS with a Lambda consumer scales elastically and processes quickly after upload, with durable buffering for bursts.

**Incorrect:**
- A: EMR is heavyweight for simple, per-file transforms.
- B: EC2 workers add ops and scaling burden.
- D: Kinesis is unnecessary; requirement is event-per-file.

### Question #98

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email. Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.

- B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.

- C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.

- D. Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the message is read before processing.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** With SQS standard + Lambda, ensure the visibility timeout exceeds the function processing time (and batch window) to avoid reprocessing and duplicate emails.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Long polling doesn’t prevent duplicate deliveries.
- B: Converting to FIFO may reduce dupes but adds ordering/dedup constraints and is unnecessary; visibility is the core fix.
- D: Deleting immediately risks data loss on processing failure and is not the intended flow.

### Question #100

A company's containerized application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application needs to download security certicates before it can communicate with other business applications. The company wants a highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt the certicates in near real time. The solution also needs to store data in highly available storage after the data is encrypted. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create AWS Secrets Manager secrets for encrypted certicates. Manually update the certicates as needed. Control access to the data by using ne-grained IAM access.

- B. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Python cryptography library to receive and perform encryption operations. Store the function in an Amazon S3 bucket.

- C. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon S3.

- D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use KMS CMK for encrypt/decrypt operations from the EC2 role; store encrypted material in Amazon S3 for high durability/availability.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Secrets Manager is for secret storage/rotation, not general-purpose crypto and storage.
- B: DIY crypto in Lambda is unnecessary and adds latency/ops.
- D: EBS is tied to one AZ/instance and is less durable/available than S3.

- D. Add a resource-based policy to the function with lambda:InvokeFunction as the action and Service: events.amazonaws.com as the principal.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** EventBridge (events.amazonaws.com) needs permission to invoke the function via a resource-based policy with action lambda:InvokeFunction (least privilege).

**Incorrect:**
- A: Execution roles are assumed by the function, not by the invoker.
- B: Execution roles are assumed by the function, not by the invoker.
- C: lambda:* is overprivileged; principle of least privilege is violated.

### Question #108

A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems. Which design should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.

- B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.

- C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

- D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Use RDS event notifications to an SNS topic, fan out to multiple SQS queues, and use Lambda functions to update each target. This provides decoupling and fan-out.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Lambda cannot be triggered directly by row-level RDS updates. FIFO also does not fix that limitation.
- B: Lambda cannot be triggered directly by row-level RDS updates. FIFO also does not fix that limitation.
- C: The SQS->SNS fan-out order is reversed.

E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.

**Correct:** C, D
**Why:** Upload directly from the browser to S3 via presigned URLs (decouples and improves performance). Use S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function to resize images asynchronously.

**Incorrect:**
- A: S3 Glacier is for archival, not active uploads.
- B: Uploading through the web server keeps tight coupling and increases latency.
- E: A scheduled job introduces delay and unnecessary polling.

### Question #207

A company owns an asynchronous API that is used to ingest user requests and, based on the request type, dispatch requests to the appropriate microservice for processing. The company is using Amazon API Gateway to deploy the API front end, and an AWS Lambda function that invokes Amazon DynamoDB to store user requests before dispatching them to the processing microservices. The company provisioned as much DynamoDB throughput as its budget allows, but the company is still experiencing availability issues and is losing user requests. What should a solutions architect do to address this issue without impacting existing users?

- A. Add throttling on the API Gateway with server-side throttling limits.

- B. Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.

- C. Create a secondary index in DynamoDB for the table with the user requests.

- D. Use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Buffer with SQS and use Lambda to batch writes to DynamoDB to reduce throttling and availability issues.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Throttling at API Gateway still loses requests under high load.
- B: DAX accelerates reads, not writes.
- C: Secondary index doesn’t address write capacity or availability.

### Question #228

A company has an API that receives real-time data from a eet of monitoring devices. The API stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the monitoring devices send to the API uctuates. During periods of heavy trac, the API often returns timeout errors. After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of processing the volume of write trac that comes from the API. A solutions architect must minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy trac. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Increase the size of the DB instance to an instance type that has more available memory.

- B. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ DB instance. Configure the application to write to all active RDS DB instances.

- C. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database.

- D. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SNS invokes to write data from the topic to the database.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Buffer writes to SQS; Lambda consumer batches and reduces DB connection pressure and failed timeouts.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Upsizing doesn’t solve connection storms.
- B: Multi‑AZ doesn’t increase write throughput.
- D: SNS is pub/sub, not a durable write buffer.

### Question #137

A company uses AWS Organizations to create dedicated AWS accounts for each business unit to manage each business unit's account independently upon request. The root email recipient missed a notification that was sent to the root user email address of one account. The company wants to ensure that all future notications are not missed. Future notications must be limited to account administrators. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Configure the company’s email server to forward notification email messages that are sent to the AWS account root user email address to all users in the organization.

- B. Configure all AWS account root user email addresses as distribution lists that go to a few administrators who can respond to alerts. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.

- C. Configure all AWS account root user email messages to be sent to one administrator who is responsible for monitoring alerts and forwarding those alerts to the appropriate groups.

- D. Configure all existing AWS accounts and all newly created accounts to use the same root user email address. Configure AWS account alternate contacts in the AWS Organizations console or programmatically.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Use distribution lists for root user email to a small admin group, and configure alternate contacts centrally (via Organizations) so admin contacts receive AWS notices.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Broad or single-recipient forwarding increases risk of missed or inappropriate notifications.
- C: Broad or single-recipient forwarding increases risk of missed or inappropriate notifications.
- D: Using the same root email across accounts is a bad practice; alternate contacts are the right mechanism.

### Question #151

A company wants to migrate its on-premises data center to AWS. According to the company's compliance requirements, the company can use only the ap-northeast-3 Region. Company administrators are not permitted to connect VPCs to the internet. Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Use AWS Control Tower to implement data residency guardrails to deny internet access and deny access to all AWS Regions except ap- northeast-3.

- B. Use rules in AWS WAF to prevent internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3 in the AWS account settings.

- C. Use AWS Organizations to configure service control policies (SCPS) that prevent VPCs from gaining internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.

- D. Create an outbound rule for the network ACL in each VPC to deny all trac from 0.0.0.0/0. Create an IAM policy for each user to prevent the use of any AWS Region other than ap-northeast-3.

E. Use AWS Cong to activate managed rules to detect and alert for internet gateways and to detect and alert for new resources deployed outside of ap-northeast-3.

**Correct:** A, C
**Why:** Use organization-wide guardrails. AWS Control Tower guardrails or Organizations SCPs can enforce data residency (Region allow list) and deny internet access (e.g., prevent IGWs/NATs). This meets compliance and prevents admins from attaching internet egress.

**Incorrect:**
- B: WAF protects web apps, not VPC egress. Account settings cannot globally deny Regions.
- D: NACL rules are per-subnet and error‑prone; IAM policies don’t restrict Region usage account-wide.
- E: AWS Config detects and alerts; it does not enforce.

### Question #207

A company owns an asynchronous API that is used to ingest user requests and, based on the request type, dispatch requests to the appropriate microservice for processing. The company is using Amazon API Gateway to deploy the API front end, and an AWS Lambda function that invokes Amazon DynamoDB to store user requests before dispatching them to the processing microservices. The company provisioned as much DynamoDB throughput as its budget allows, but the company is still experiencing availability issues and is losing user requests. What should a solutions architect do to address this issue without impacting existing users?

- A. Add throttling on the API Gateway with server-side throttling limits.

- B. Use DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.

- C. Create a secondary index in DynamoDB for the table with the user requests.

- D. Use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue and Lambda to buffer writes to DynamoDB.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Buffer with SQS and use Lambda to batch writes to DynamoDB to reduce throttling and availability issues.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Throttling at API Gateway still loses requests under high load.
- B: DAX accelerates reads, not writes.
- C: Secondary index doesn’t address write capacity or availability.

- B. Upload the data from each site to an S3 bucket in the closest Region. Use S3 Cross-Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket. Then remove the data from the origin S3 bucket.

- C. Schedule AWS Snowball Edge Storage Optimized device jobs daily to transfer data from each site to the closest Region. Use S3 Cross- Region Replication to copy objects to the destination S3 bucket.

- D. Upload the data from each site to an Amazon EC2 instance in the closest Region. Store the data in an Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume. At regular intervals, take an EBS snapshot and copy it to the Region that contains the destination S3 bucket. Restore the EBS volume in that Region.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** S3 Transfer Acceleration with multipart upload securely leverages edge-optimized network paths from any site to a single S3 bucket with minimal setup and no servers to manage.

**Incorrect:**
- B: CRR is asynchronous and adds replication lag/overhead; it requires multiple buckets and cleanup.
- C: Snowball Edge is for offline/large migrations, not daily 500 GB/site with high-speed Internet.
- D: EC2/EBS snapshots add complexity, cost, and delay.

### Question #5

A company is hosting a web application on AWS using a single Amazon EC2 instance that stores user-uploaded documents in an Amazon EBS volume. For better scalability and availability, the company duplicated the architecture and created a second EC2 instance and EBS volume in another Availability Zone, placing both behind an Application Load Balancer. After completing this change, users reported that, each time they refreshed the website, they could see one subset of their documents or the other, but never all of the documents at the same time. What should a solutions architect propose to ensure users see all of their documents at once?

- A. Copy the data so both EBS volumes contain all the documents

- B. Configure the Application Load Balancer to direct a user to the server with the documents

- C. Copy the data from both EBS volumes to Amazon EFS. Modify the application to save new documents to Amazon EFS

- D. Configure the Application Load Balancer to send the request to both servers. Return each document from the correct server

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use Amazon EFS as shared storage across AZs so all instances see the same documents.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Copying EBS volumes duplicates data and is hard to keep consistent.
- B: ALB can’t ensure session-to-data affinity reliably.
- D: Dual-serve from both servers is complex and brittle.

### Question #7

A company has an application that ingests incoming messages. Dozens of other applications and microservices then quickly consume these messages. The number of messages varies drastically and sometimes increases suddenly to 100,000 each second. The company wants to decouple the solution and increase scalability. Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Persist the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. Configure the consumer applications to read and process the messages.

- B. Deploy the ingestion application on Amazon EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group to scale the number of EC2 instances based on CPU metrics.

- C. Write the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with a single shard. Use an AWS Lambda function to preprocess messages and store them in Amazon DynamoDB. Configure the consumer applications to read from DynamoDB to process the messages.

- D. Publish the messages to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SOS) subscriptions. Configure the consumer applications to process the messages from the queues.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** SNS topic with multiple SQS subscriptions provides high fan-out, decoupling, and horizontal scalability for many consumers.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Kinesis Data Analytics is for streaming analytics, not pub/sub fan-out to many apps.
- B: Scaling EC2 producers doesn’t decouple consumers.
- C: Single Kinesis shard cannot handle 100k msgs/sec; also adds DynamoDB dependency unnecessarily.

### Question #18

An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

- B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

- C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.

- D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.

E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

**Correct:** A, B
**Why:** S3 event to SQS decouples; Lambda polled by SQS scales and deletes messages after success for durability and idempotency.

**Incorrect:**
- C: Lambda S3 direct trigger is fine but lacks durable queueing under burst; tracking in-memory is fragile.
- D: EC2 poller and SNS email alert aren’t required.
- E: EC2 poller and SNS email alert aren’t required.

### Question #100

A company's containerized application runs on an Amazon EC2 instance. The application needs to download security certicates before it can communicate with other business applications. The company wants a highly secure solution to encrypt and decrypt the certicates in near real time. The solution also needs to store data in highly available storage after the data is encrypted. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create AWS Secrets Manager secrets for encrypted certicates. Manually update the certicates as needed. Control access to the data by using ne-grained IAM access.

- B. Create an AWS Lambda function that uses the Python cryptography library to receive and perform encryption operations. Store the function in an Amazon S3 bucket.

- C. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon S3.

- D. Create an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key. Allow the EC2 role to use the KMS key for encryption operations. Store the encrypted data on Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use KMS CMK for encrypt/decrypt operations from the EC2 role; store encrypted material in Amazon S3 for high durability/availability.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Secrets Manager is for secret storage/rotation, not general-purpose crypto and storage.
- B: DIY crypto in Lambda is unnecessary and adds latency/ops.
- D: EBS is tied to one AZ/instance and is less durable/available than S3.

### Question #101

A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates. What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?

- A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC trac to the NAT gateway in its AZ.

- B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC trac to the NAT instance in its AZ.

- C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC trac to the private internet gateway.

- D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC trac to the egress-only Internet gateway.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Private subnets with IPv4 require a NAT device in a public subnet to reach the internet. Creating one NAT gateway per AZ and routing private subnet traffic in that AZ to its NAT gateway provides high availability and zone-local egress.

**Incorrect:**
- B: NAT instances are legacy, require manual management, and must be in public subnets. Also, creating one per private subnet is unnecessary and less available.
- C: You cannot attach an internet gateway to a subnet. IGWs attach to the VPC and do not make private subnets public.
- D: Egress-only internet gateways are for IPv6 only. The VPC uses IPv4.

### Question #102

A company wants to migrate an on-premises data center to AWS. The data center hosts an SFTP server that stores its data on an NFS-based file system. The server holds 200 GB of data that needs to be transferred. The server must be hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance that uses an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to automate this task? (Choose two.)

- A. Launch the EC2 instance into the same Availability Zone as the EFS file system.

- B. Install an AWS DataSync agent in the on-premises data center.

- C. Create a secondary Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume on the EC2 instance for the data.

- D. Manually use an operating system copy command to push the data to the EC2 instance.

E. Use AWS DataSync to create a suitable location configuration for the on-premises SFTP server.

**Correct:** B, E
**Why:** Use AWS DataSync to automate NFS/SFTP-to-EFS transfers. Install a DataSync agent on premises and configure an on-premises SFTP (or NFS) location and an EFS destination location. DataSync handles incremental, parallelized transfer and verification.

**Incorrect:**
- A: EFS is regional and can be mounted from any AZ; co-locating the EC2 instance is not required for the DataSync transfer.
- C: EBS is not needed; destination is EFS.
- D: Manual copy is not automated and defeats the purpose.

### Question #104

A solutions architect must design a highly available infrastructure for a website. The website is powered by Windows web servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The solutions architect must implement a solution that can mitigate a large-scale DDoS attack that originates from thousands of IP addresses. Downtime is not acceptable for the website. Which actions should the solutions architect take to protect the website from such an attack? (Choose two.)

- A. Use AWS Shield Advanced to stop the DDoS attack.

- B. Configure Amazon GuardDuty to automatically block the attackers.

- C. Configure the website to use Amazon CloudFront for both static and dynamic content.

- D. Use an AWS Lambda function to automatically add attacker IP addresses to VPC network ACLs.

E. Use EC2 Spot Instances in an Auto Scaling group with a target tracking scaling policy that is set to 80% CPU utilization.

**Correct:** A, C
**Why:** AWS Shield Advanced provides advanced DDoS protection. CloudFront absorbs and isolates traffic at edge locations and can protect dynamic and static content.

**Incorrect:**
- B: GuardDuty detects threats; it does not automatically block DDoS attacks.
- D: Automatically inserting attacker IPs into NACLs is brittle and not scalable for large DDoS campaigns.
- E: Spot Instances do not mitigate DDoS.

### Question #110

A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website. The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally ecient process for image uploads. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier.

- B. Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.

- C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL

- D. Configure S3 Event Notications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.

E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.

**Correct:** C, D
**Why:** Upload directly from the browser to S3 via presigned URLs (decouples and improves performance). Use S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function to resize images asynchronously.

**Incorrect:**
- A: S3 Glacier is for archival, not active uploads.
- B: Uploading through the web server keeps tight coupling and increases latency.
- E: A scheduled job introduces delay and unnecessary polling.

### Question #115

A medical records company is hosting an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes customer data files that are stored on Amazon S3. The EC2 instances are hosted in public subnets. The EC2 instances access Amazon S3 over the internet, but they do not require any other network access. A new requirement mandates that the network trac for file transfers take a private route and not be sent over the internet. Which change to the network architecture should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

- A. Create a NAT gateway. Configure the route table for the public subnets to send trac to Amazon S3 through the NAT gateway.

- B. Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to restrict outbound trac so that only trac to the S3 prex list is permitted.

- C. Move the EC2 instances to private subnets. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, and link the endpoint to the route table for the private subnets.

- D. Remove the internet gateway from the VPC. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection, and route trac to Amazon S3 over the Direct Connect connection.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Move EC2 instances to private subnets and use an S3 gateway VPC endpoint for private S3 access without traversing the internet.

**Incorrect:**
- A: NAT gateways still traverse the internet for S3.
- B: Security groups don’t create private paths.
- D: Direct Connect is unnecessary and costly for this requirement.

### Question #140

A solutions architect needs to help a company optimize the cost of running an application on AWS. The application will use Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Fargate, and AWS Lambda for compute within the architecture. The EC2 instances will run the data ingestion layer of the application. EC2 usage will be sporadic and unpredictable. Workloads that run on EC2 instances can be interrupted at any time. The application front end will run on Fargate, and Lambda will serve the API layer. The front-end utilization and API layer utilization will be predictable over the course of the next year. Which combination of purchasing options will provide the MOST cost-effective solution for hosting this application? (Choose two.)

- A. Use Spot Instances for the data ingestion layer

- B. Use On-Demand Instances for the data ingestion layer

- C. Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.

- D. Purchase 1-year All Upfront Reserved instances for the data ingestion layer.

E. Purchase a 1-year EC2 instance Savings Plan for the front end and API layer.

**Correct:** A, C
**Why:** Use Spot Instances for sporadic, interruptible EC2 ingestion. Purchase a 1-year Compute Savings Plan for predictable Fargate and Lambda usage.

**Incorrect:**
- B: On-Demand costs more for this interruptible workload.
- D: RIs or EC2 Instance Savings Plans do not apply to Fargate/Lambda (Compute Savings Plan does).
- E: RIs or EC2 Instance Savings Plans do not apply to Fargate/Lambda (Compute Savings Plan does).

### Question #141

A company runs a web-based portal that provides users with global breaking news, local alerts, and weather updates. The portal delivers each user a personalized view by using mixture of static and dynamic content. Content is served over HTTPS through an API server running on an Amazon EC2 instance behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The company wants the portal to provide this content to its users across the world as quickly as possible. How should a solutions architect design the application to ensure the LEAST amount of latency for all users?

- A. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve all static and dynamic content by specifying the ALB as an origin.

- B. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 latency routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the closest Region.

- C. Deploy the application stack in a single AWS Region. Use Amazon CloudFront to serve the static content. Serve the dynamic content directly from the ALB.

- D. Deploy the application stack in two AWS Regions. Use an Amazon Route 53 geolocation routing policy to serve all content from the ALB in the closest Region.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Deploy the stack in one Region and use CloudFront to serve both static and dynamic content (ALB as origin) globally with minimal latency.

**Incorrect:**
- B: Multi-Region adds ops complexity; CloudFront already optimizes latency.

### Question #150

A company is migrating an application from on-premises servers to Amazon EC2 instances. As part of the migration design requirements, a solutions architect must implement infrastructure metric alarms. The company does not need to take action if CPU utilization increases to more than 50% for a short burst of time. However, if the CPU utilization increases to more than 50% and read IOPS on the disk are high at the same time, the company needs to act as soon as possible. The solutions architect also must reduce false alarms. What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create Amazon CloudWatch composite alarms where possible.

- B. Create Amazon CloudWatch dashboards to visualize the metrics and react to issues quickly.

- C. Create Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics canaries to monitor the application and raise an alarm.

- D. Create single Amazon CloudWatch metric alarms with multiple metric thresholds where possible.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** CloudWatch composite alarms evaluate multiple metrics/alarms (CPU and read IOPS) together to reduce false positives and alert only when both conditions are met.

**Incorrect:**
- B: Dashboards visualize metrics but do not generate actionable alarms.
- C: Synthetics is for endpoint canaries, not infrastructure metric correlation.

### Question #49

A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year- old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- A. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.

- B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.

- C. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.

- D. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** S3 Standard for <1 year; after 1 year, transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive; store searchable metadata in RDS for discovery.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Glacier Instant Retrieval is overkill/costly for >1‑year rarely accessed data.
- B: Athena cannot query Glacier directly; Glacier Select is niche.
- C: Managing tags in S3 for search is limiting; IR after 1 year costs more than DA.

### Question #53

A company needs to store its accounting records in Amazon S3. The records must be immediately accessible for 1 year and then must be archived for an additional 9 years. No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records during the entire 10-year period. The records must be stored with maximum resiliency. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Store the records in S3 Glacier for the entire 10-year period. Use an access control policy to deny deletion of the records for a period of 10 years.

- B. Store the records by using S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use an IAM policy to deny deletion of the records. After 10 years, change the IAM policy to allow deletion.

- C. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.

- D. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode for a period of 10 years.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Keep 1 year in S3 Standard, then lifecycle to S3 Glacier Deep Archive; enforce S3 Object Lock compliance mode for 10 years to prevent any deletion, with maximum resiliency.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Glacier only for entire period prevents immediate access in year 1 and does not itself prevent deletion.
- B: IAM policy changes are operationally brittle and do not guarantee WORM compliance.
- D: One Zone-IA reduces resiliency and governance mode can be overridden by privileged users.

### Question #55

A solutions architect is developing a VPC architecture that includes multiple subnets. The architecture will host applications that use Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The architecture consists of six subnets in two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone includes a public subnet, a private subnet, and a dedicated subnet for databases. Only EC2 instances that run in the private subnets can have access to the RDS databases. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Create a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks. Associate the route table with the database subnets.

- B. Create a security group that denies inbound trac from the security group that is assigned to instances in the public subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.

- C. Create a security group that allows inbound trac from the security group that is assigned to instances in the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.

- D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets. Create a different peering connection between the private subnets and the database subnets.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use security groups to allow inbound to the DB from the security group attached to private-tier EC2 only; least privilege and simple.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Route tables do not enforce security at instance level.
- B: Security groups are allow lists; “deny” rules are not supported.
- D: VPC peering within the same VPC is not a thing and peering is unnecessary.

### Question #56

A company has registered its domain name with Amazon Route 53. The company uses Amazon API Gateway in the ca-central-1 Region as a public interface for its backend microservice APIs. Third-party services consume the APIs securely. The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certicate so that the third-party services can use HTTPS. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM).

- B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.

- C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certicate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route trac to the API Gateway endpoint.

- D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certicate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use a Regional API Gateway custom domain with an ACM certificate in the same Region; route the custom domain with Route 53.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Stage variables do not implement custom domains or TLS.
- B: ACM certs for Regional endpoints must be in the same Region as the API, not us-east-1 (that’s for CloudFront).
- D: ACM certs for Regional endpoints must be in the same Region as the API, not us-east-1 (that’s for CloudFront).

### Question #61

A company is developing a two-tier web application on AWS. The company's developers have deployed the application on an Amazon EC2 instance that connects directly to a backend Amazon RDS database. The company must not hardcode database credentials in the application. The company must also implement a solution to automatically rotate the database credentials on a regular basis. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Store the database credentials in the instance metadata. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda function that updates the RDS credentials and instance metadata at the same time.

- B. Store the database credentials in a configuration file in an encrypted Amazon S3 bucket. Use Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rules to run a scheduled AWS Lambda function that updates the RDS credentials and the credentials in the configuration file at the same time. Use S3 Versioning to ensure the ability to fall back to previous values.

- C. Store the database credentials as a secret in AWS Secrets Manager. Turn on automatic rotation for the secret. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the secret.

- D. Store the database credentials as encrypted parameters in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store. Turn on automatic rotation for the encrypted parameters. Attach the required permission to the EC2 role to grant access to the encrypted parameters.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Store DB credentials in Secrets Manager with automatic rotation; grant the EC2 instance role permission to read the secret.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Storing in metadata/S3 with Lambda rotation is brittle and higher ops.
- B: Storing in metadata/S3 with Lambda rotation is brittle and higher ops.
- D: Parameter Store’s automatic rotation is limited compared to Secrets Manager’s RDS-native rotation.

---

### Question #67

A company hosts an application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes messages from an Amazon SQS queue, writes to an Amazon RDS table, and deletes the message from the queue. Occasional duplicate records are found in the RDS table. The SQS queue does not contain any duplicate messages. What should a solutions architect do to ensure messages are being processed once only?

- A. Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue.

- B. Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions.

- C. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time.

- D. Use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** If processing takes longer than the visibility timeout, messages reappear and cause duplicates; increase visibility timeout appropriately.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Queue creation/permissions don’t address duplicates.
- B: Queue creation/permissions don’t address duplicates.
- C: Long polling reduces empty receives, not duplicates.


---

---

### Question #69

A company is running a business-critical web application on Amazon EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The EC2 instances are in an Auto Scaling group. The application uses an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database that is deployed in a single Availability Zone. The company wants the application to be highly available with minimum downtime and minimum loss of data. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational effort?

- A. Place the EC2 instances in different AWS Regions. Use Amazon Route 53 health checks to redirect trac. Use Aurora PostgreSQL Cross- Region Replication.

- B. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple Availability Zones. Configure the database as Multi-AZ. Configure an Amazon RDS Proxy instance for the database.

- C. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use one Availability Zone. Generate hourly snapshots of the database. Recover the database from the snapshots in the event of a failure.

- D. Configure the Auto Scaling group to use multiple AWS Regions. Write the data from the application to Amazon S3. Use S3 Event Notications to launch an AWS Lambda function to write the data to the database.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Make EC2 tier Multi-AZ and configure the Aurora PostgreSQL DB for Multi-AZ (Aurora Replicas across AZs). An RDS Proxy can help connection resiliency.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Multi-Region here is unnecessary and complex.
- C: Snapshots restore causes long downtime and potential data loss.
- D: Multi-Region here is unnecessary and complex.

---

### Question #86

A company has several web servers that need to frequently access a common Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance. The company wants a secure method for the web servers to connect to the database while meeting a security requirement to rotate user credentials frequently. Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Store the database user credentials in AWS Secrets Manager. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access AWS Secrets Manager.

- B. Store the database user credentials in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to access OpsCenter.

- C. Store the database user credentials in a secure Amazon S3 bucket. Grant the necessary IAM permissions to allow the web servers to retrieve credentials and access the database.

- D. Store the database user credentials in files encrypted with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) on the web server file system. The web server should be able to decrypt the files and access the database.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Secrets Manager securely stores and rotates DB credentials; web servers assume IAM roles to retrieve them.

**Incorrect:**
- B: OpsCenter is unrelated to secret storage.
- C: S3 is not intended for secrets.
- D: Local encrypted files complicate rotation and distribution.


---

---

### Question #87

A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the event. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.

- B. Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.

- C. Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.

- D. Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Queue customer events in SQS FIFO during DB upgrades; a separate Lambda polls the queue and writes when DB is available so no data is lost.

**Incorrect:**
- A: RDS Proxy helps with connection pooling but cannot accept writes during DB unavailability.
- B: Extending Lambda run time and retries still loses events when the DB is down.
- C: Lambda local storage is ephemeral and not durable.

---

### Question #90

A company is using a SQL database to store movie data that is publicly accessible. The database runs on an Amazon RDS Single-AZ DB instance. A script runs queries at random intervals each day to record the number of new movies that have been added to the database. The script must report a nal total during business hours. The company's development team notices that the database performance is inadequate for development tasks when the script is running. A solutions architect must recommend a solution to resolve this issue. Which solution will meet this requirement with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ deployment.

- B. Create a read replica of the database. Configure the script to query only the read replica.

- C. Instruct the development team to manually export the entries in the database at the end of each day.

- D. Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache the common queries that the script runs against the database.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Offload read queries to an RDS read replica so production write performance is not impacted; low operational effort.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Multi-AZ is for HA/failover, not read scaling.
- C: Manual exports add labor and don’t solve load.
- D: ElastiCache doesn’t help the arbitrary reporting script as directly as a read replica.


---

---

### Question #93

A company runs an on-premises application that is powered by a MySQL database. The company is migrating the application to AWS to increase the application's elasticity and availability. The current architecture shows heavy read activity on the database during times of normal operation. Every 4 hours, the company's development team pulls a full export of the production database to populate a database in the staging environment. During this period, users experience unacceptable application latency. The development team is unable to use the staging environment until the procedure completes. A solutions architect must recommend replacement architecture that alleviates the application latency issue. The replacement architecture also must give the development team the ability to continue using the staging environment without delay. Which solution meets these requirements?

- A. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.

- B. Use Amazon Aurora MySQL with Multi-AZ Aurora Replicas for production. Use database cloning to create the staging database on-demand.

- C. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Use the standby instance for the staging database.

- D. Use Amazon RDS for MySQL with a Multi-AZ deployment and read replicas for production. Populate the staging database by implementing a backup and restore process that uses the mysqldump utility.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Aurora MySQL with Aurora Replicas handles reads; use fast database cloning to create a staging copy on demand without impacting production.

**Incorrect:**
- A: mysqldump backup/restore is slow and blocks the staging environment.
- C: Standby cannot be used; it’s for failover.
- D: mysqldump every 4 hours still causes impact and delay.


---

---

### Question #95

An application allows users at a company's headquarters to access product data. The product data is stored in an Amazon RDS MySQL DB instance. The operations team has isolated an application performance slowdown and wants to separate read trac from write trac. A solutions architect needs to optimize the application's performance quickly. What should the solutions architect recommend?

- A. Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the primary Availability Zone.

- B. Change the existing database to a Multi-AZ deployment. Serve the read requests from the secondary Availability Zone.

- C. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with half of the compute and storage resources as the source database.

- D. Create read replicas for the database. Configure the read replicas with the same compute and storage resources as the source database.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Create read replicas sized like the primary to handle read load quickly without further tuning.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Multi-AZ improves availability, not read scaling.
- B: Multi-AZ improves availability, not read scaling.
- C: Smaller replicas may not handle expected read load.

### Question #101

A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates. What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?

- A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC trac to the NAT gateway in its AZ.

- B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC trac to the NAT instance in its AZ.

- C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC trac to the private internet gateway.

- D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC trac to the egress-only Internet gateway.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Private subnets with IPv4 require a NAT device in a public subnet to reach the internet. Creating one NAT gateway per AZ and routing private subnet traffic in that AZ to its NAT gateway provides high availability and zone-local egress.

**Incorrect:**
- B: NAT instances are legacy, require manual management, and must be in public subnets. Also, creating one per private subnet is unnecessary and less available.
- C: You cannot attach an internet gateway to a subnet. IGWs attach to the VPC and do not make private subnets public.
- D: Egress-only internet gateways are for IPv6 only. The VPC uses IPv4.

### Question #108

A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems. Which design should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.

- B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.

- C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

- D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Use RDS event notifications to an SNS topic, fan out to multiple SQS queues, and use Lambda functions to update each target. This provides decoupling and fan-out.

**Incorrect:**

The company wants to design its API Gateway URL with the company's domain name and corresponding certicate so that the third-party services can use HTTPS. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Create stage variables in API Gateway with Name="Endpoint-URL" and Value="Company Domain Name" to overwrite the default URL. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM).

- B. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point the alias record to the Regional API Gateway stage endpoint. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region.

- C. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM) in the same Region. Attach the certicate to the API Gateway endpoint. Configure Route 53 to route trac to the API Gateway endpoint.

- D. Create a Regional API Gateway endpoint. Associate the API Gateway endpoint with the company's domain name. Import the public certicate associated with the company's domain name into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM) in the us-east-1 Region. Attach the certicate to the API Gateway APIs. Create Route 53 DNS records with the company's domain name. Point an A record to the company's domain name.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use a Regional API Gateway custom domain with an ACM certificate in the same Region; route the custom domain with Route 53.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Stage variables do not implement custom domains or TLS.
- B: ACM certs for Regional endpoints must be in the same Region as the API, not us-east-1 (that’s for CloudFront).
- D: ACM certs for Regional endpoints must be in the same Region as the API, not us-east-1 (that’s for CloudFront).

### Question #17

A company is implementing a new business application. The application runs on two Amazon EC2 instances and uses an Amazon S3 bucket for document storage. A solutions architect needs to ensure that the EC2 instances can access the S3 bucket. What should the solutions architect do to meet this requirement?

- A. Create an IAM role that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the role to the EC2 instances.

- B. Create an IAM policy that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the policy to the EC2 instances.

- C. Create an IAM group that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the group to the EC2 instances.

- D. Create an IAM user that grants access to the S3 bucket. Attach the user account to the EC2 instances.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Attach an IAM role (instance profile) to EC2 to grant S3 access—least privilege, no static creds.

**Incorrect:**
- B: You cannot attach policies/groups/users to instances; and static users are bad practice.
- C: You cannot attach policies/groups/users to instances; and static users are bad practice.
- D: You cannot attach policies/groups/users to instances; and static users are bad practice.

### Question #18

An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

- B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

- C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.

- D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.

E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

**Correct:** A, B
**Why:** S3 event to SQS decouples; Lambda polled by SQS scales and deletes messages after success for durability and idempotency.

**Incorrect:**
- C: Lambda S3 direct trigger is fine but lacks durable queueing under burst; tracking in-memory is fragile.
- D: EC2 poller and SNS email alert aren’t required.
- E: EC2 poller and SNS email alert aren’t required.

The company wants to be able to handle millions of requests each hour with millisecond latency during peak hours. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use Amazon S3 to host the full website in different S3 buckets. Add Amazon CloudFront distributions. Set the S3 buckets as origins for the distributions. Store the order data in Amazon S3.

- B. Deploy the full website on Amazon EC2 instances that run in Auto Scaling groups across multiple Availability Zones. Add an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute the website trac. Add another ALB for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.

- C. Migrate the full application to run in containers. Host the containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use the Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler to increase and decrease the number of pods to process bursts in trac. Store the data in Amazon RDS for MySQL.

- D. Use an Amazon S3 bucket to host the website's static content. Deploy an Amazon CloudFront distribution. Set the S3 bucket as the origin. Use Amazon API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions for the backend APIs. Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Static content on S3 + CloudFront; APIs via API Gateway + Lambda; DynamoDB for high scale—serverless and low ops.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Heavier ops and won’t scale as easily with least overhead.
- B: Heavier ops and won’t scale as easily with least overhead.
- C: Heavier ops and won’t scale as easily with least overhead.

### Question #33

A company runs an online marketplace web application on AWS. The application serves hundreds of thousands of users during peak hours. The company needs a scalable, near-real-time solution to share the details of millions of nancial transactions with several other internal applications. Transactions also need to be processed to remove sensitive data before being stored in a document database for low-latency retrieval. What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Store the transactions data into Amazon DynamoDB. Set up a rule in DynamoDB to remove sensitive data from every transaction upon write. Use DynamoDB Streams to share the transactions data with other applications.

- B. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to store data in Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3. Use AWS Lambda integration with Kinesis Data Firehose to remove sensitive data. Other applications can consume the data stored in Amazon S3.

- C. Stream the transactions data into Amazon Kinesis Data Streams. Use AWS Lambda integration to remove sensitive data from every transaction and then store the transactions data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume the transactions data off the Kinesis data stream.

- D. Store the batched transactions data in Amazon S3 as files. Use AWS Lambda to process every file and remove sensitive data before updating the files in Amazon S3. The Lambda function then stores the data in Amazon DynamoDB. Other applications can consume transaction files stored in Amazon S3.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Kinesis Data Streams + Lambda to redact PII and write to DynamoDB for low‑latency retrieval; other apps can consume the stream.

**Incorrect:**
- A: DynamoDB stream as primary ingest is incorrect; also redaction at write rule isn’t native.
- B: Firehose→DynamoDB is not supported directly; Firehose is for S3/OS/Redshift.
- D: Batch in S3 is not near real‑time.

### Question #36

A company is building an application in the AWS Cloud. The application will store data in Amazon S3 buckets in two AWS Regions. The company must use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer managed key to encrypt all data that is stored in the S3 buckets. The data in both S3 buckets must be encrypted and decrypted with the same KMS key. The data and the key must be stored in each of the two Regions. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

- B. Create a customer managed multi-Region KMS key. Create an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure replication between the S3 buckets. Configure the application to use the KMS key with client-side encryption.

- C. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys (SSE-S3). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

- D. Create a customer managed KMS key and an S3 bucket in each Region. Configure the S3 buckets to use server-side encryption with AWS KMS keys (SSE-KMS). Configure replication between the S3 buckets.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Multi‑Region KMS keys allow the “same” customer managed key in two Regions. Among options, B meets the same‑key requirement (though SSE‑KMS would also work).

**Incorrect:**
- A: SSE‑S3 does not use a customer managed KMS key.
- C: SSE‑S3 does not use a customer managed KMS key.
- D: Separate regional KMS keys are not the same key.

### Question #40

A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis. The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days. What is the MOST operationally ecient solution that meets these requirements?

- A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.

- B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.

- C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days.

- D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Firehose→S3 is fully managed and HA. S3 Lifecycle transitions to Glacier after 14 days for cost control.

**Incorrect:**
- B: EC2+ELB adds ops.
- C: OpenSearch is costly and unnecessary for simple storage/retention.
- D: SQS retention is max 14 days and not long‑term storage.

### Question #41

A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create an Auto Scaling group so that EC2 instances can scale out. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

- B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

- C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for each SaaS source to send output data. Configure the S3 bucket as the rule's target. Create a second EventBridge (Cloud Watch Events) rule to send events when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the second rule's target.

- D. Create a Docker container to use instead of an EC2 instance. Host the containerized application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Amazon AppFlow ingests data from many SaaS apps directly to S3. S3 event to SNS notifies on upload; minimal ops.

**Incorrect:**
- A: EC2 ingestion adds scaling/ops.
- C: EventBridge/ECS are unnecessary here.
- D: EventBridge/ECS are unnecessary here.

### Question #46

A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size. Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

- A. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.

- B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

- C. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

- D. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Amazon Macie automatically discovers PII in S3 and can alert via SNS/EventBridge; least dev effort. Remediation can be automated from the alert.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Inspector doesn’t scan S3 for PII.
- C: Custom PII detection is heavy dev; lifecycle cannot conditionally delete on PII.
- D: Custom PII detection is heavy dev; lifecycle cannot conditionally delete on PII.

- B. Deploy a larger EC2 instance with a larger instance store.

- C. Move the catalog from the instance store to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

- D. Move the catalog to an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** EFS provides shared, durable, multi‑AZ storage for catalogs across instances.

**Incorrect:**
- A: ElastiCache is a cache, not durable storage.
- B: Larger instance store is ephemeral.
- C: Glacier DA is archival, not live catalog storage.


---

---

### Question #49

A company stores call transcript files on a monthly basis. Users access the files randomly within 1 year of the call, but users access the files infrequently after 1 year. The company wants to optimize its solution by giving users the ability to query and retrieve files that are less than 1-year- old as quickly as possible. A delay in retrieving older files is acceptable. Which solution will meet these requirements MOST cost-effectively?

- A. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval. Query the tags to retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.

- B. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files that are in Amazon S3 by using Amazon Athena. Query and retrieve the files that are in S3 Glacier by using S3 Glacier Select.

- C. Store individual files with tags in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Store search metadata for each archive in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval after 1 year. Query and retrieve the files by searching for metadata from Amazon S3.

- D. Store individual files in Amazon S3 Standard storage. Use S3 Lifecycle policies to move the files to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Store search metadata in Amazon RDS. Query the files from Amazon RDS. Retrieve the files from S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** S3 Standard for <1 year; after 1 year, transition to S3 Glacier Deep Archive; store searchable metadata in RDS for discovery.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Glacier Instant Retrieval is overkill/costly for >1‑year rarely accessed data.
- B: Athena cannot query Glacier directly; Glacier Select is niche.
- C: Managing tags in S3 for search is limiting; IR after 1 year costs more than DA.

### Question #51

A company is developing an application that provides order shipping statistics for retrieval by a REST API. The company wants to extract the shipping statistics, organize the data into an easy-to-read HTML format, and send the report to several email addresses at the same time every morning. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to send the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

- B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.

- C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Glue job to query the application's API for the data.

- D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.

E. Store the application data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as an S3 event destination to send the report by email.

**Correct:** D, B
**Why:** Use an EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke a Lambda function that queries the API and formats an HTML report; use Amazon SES to send the emails on schedule.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Kinesis Data Firehose is for streaming delivery, not scheduled report generation from an API.
- C: AWS Glue is overkill and not intended to poll a REST API on a cron.
- E: S3 events trigger on S3 object changes, not on a schedule and not for building the report.

### Question #52

A company wants to migrate its on-premises application to AWS. The application produces output files that vary in size from tens of gigabytes to hundreds of terabytes. The application data must be stored in a standard file system structure. The company wants a solution that scales automatically. is highly available, and requires minimum operational overhead. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Use Amazon S3 for storage.

- B. Migrate the application to run as containers on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.

- C. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) for storage.

- D. Migrate the application to Amazon EC2 instances in a Multi-AZ Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) for storage.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** EC2 + Amazon EFS provides a standard POSIX file system that scales automatically and is highly available across AZs with low ops overhead.

**Incorrect:**
- A: S3 is object storage, not a standard file system interface for an application expecting a file system.
- B: EKS + EBS does not auto-scale storage across nodes and is per-AZ/instance; more ops.
- D: EBS is per-instance and does not scale automatically or across AZs.

### Question #53

A company needs to store its accounting records in Amazon S3. The records must be immediately accessible for 1 year and then must be archived for an additional 9 years. No one at the company, including administrative users and root users, can be able to delete the records during the entire 10-year period. The records must be stored with maximum resiliency. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Store the records in S3 Glacier for the entire 10-year period. Use an access control policy to deny deletion of the records for a period of 10 years.

- B. Store the records by using S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Use an IAM policy to deny deletion of the records. After 10 years, change the IAM policy to allow deletion.

- C. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in compliance mode for a period of 10 years.

- D. Use an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition the records from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) after 1 year. Use S3 Object Lock in governance mode for a period of 10 years.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Keep 1 year in S3 Standard, then lifecycle to S3 Glacier Deep Archive; enforce S3 Object Lock compliance mode for 10 years to prevent any deletion, with maximum resiliency.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Glacier only for entire period prevents immediate access in year 1 and does not itself prevent deletion.
- B: IAM policy changes are operationally brittle and do not guarantee WORM compliance.
- D: One Zone-IA reduces resiliency and governance mode can be overridden by privileged users.

### Question #98

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email. Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.

- B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.

- C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.

- D. Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the message is read before processing.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** With SQS standard + Lambda, ensure the visibility timeout exceeds the function processing time (and batch window) to avoid reprocessing and duplicate emails.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Long polling doesn’t prevent duplicate deliveries.
- B: Converting to FIFO may reduce dupes but adds ordering/dedup constraints and is unnecessary; visibility is the core fix.
- D: Deleting immediately risks data loss on processing failure and is not the intended flow.

### Question #109

A company needs to store data in Amazon S3 and must prevent the data from being changed. The company wants new objects that are uploaded to Amazon S3 to remain unchangeable for a nonspecic amount of time until the company decides to modify the objects. Only specic users in the company's AWS account can have the ability 10 delete the objects. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create an S3 Glacier vault. Apply a write-once, read-many (WORM) vault lock policy to the objects.

- B. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Set a retention period of 100 years. Use governance mode as the S3 bucket’s default retention mode for new objects.

- C. Create an S3 bucket. Use AWS CloudTrail to track any S3 API events that modify the objects. Upon notification, restore the modied objects from any backup versions that the company has.

- D. Create an S3 bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled. Enable versioning. Add a legal hold to the objects. Add the s3:PutObjectLegalHold permission to the IAM policies of users who need to delete the objects.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** S3 Object Lock with versioning and legal holds prevents changes for an indefinite period until the legal hold is removed. Governance mode permissions can restrict who can change holds.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Glacier Vault Lock applies to Glacier vaults, not S3 buckets.
- B: Setting 100-year retention is impractical and inflexible relative to the requirement.
- C: CloudTrail tracking does not prevent modification.

### Question #110

A social media company allows users to upload images to its website. The website runs on Amazon EC2 instances. During upload requests, the website resizes the images to a standard size and stores the resized images in Amazon S3. Users are experiencing slow upload requests to the website. The company needs to reduce coupling within the application and improve website performance. A solutions architect must design the most operationally ecient process for image uploads. Which combination of actions should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to upload images to S3 Glacier.

- B. Configure the web server to upload the original images to Amazon S3.

- C. Configure the application to upload images directly from each user's browser to Amazon S3 through the use of a presigned URL

- D. Configure S3 Event Notications to invoke an AWS Lambda function when an image is uploaded. Use the function to resize the image.

E. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that invokes an AWS Lambda function on a schedule to resize uploaded images.

**Correct:** C, D
**Why:** Upload directly from the browser to S3 via presigned URLs (decouples and improves performance). Use S3 event notifications to trigger a Lambda function to resize images asynchronously.

**Incorrect:**
- A: S3 Glacier is for archival, not active uploads.
- B: Uploading through the web server keeps tight coupling and increases latency.
- E: A scheduled job introduces delay and unnecessary polling.

### Question #114

A company has created an image analysis application in which users can upload photos and add photo frames to their images. The users upload images and metadata to indicate which photo frames they want to add to their images. The application uses a single Amazon EC2 instance and Amazon DynamoDB to store the metadata. The application is becoming more popular, and the number of users is increasing. The company expects the number of concurrent users to vary signicantly depending on the time of day and day of week. The company must ensure that the application can scale to meet the needs of the growing user base. Which solution meats these requirements?

- A. Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos and metadata in DynamoDB.

- B. Use Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose to process the photos and to store the photos and metadata.

- C. Use AWS Lambda to process the photos. Store the photos in Amazon S3. Retain DynamoDB to store the metadata.

- D. Increase the number of EC2 instances to three. Use Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volumes to store the photos and metadata.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use Lambda to process photos, store photos in S3, and keep DynamoDB for metadata. This scales elastically and minimizes ops.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Storing large photos in DynamoDB is not appropriate.
- B: Kinesis Data Firehose is for streaming delivery, not image processing.
- D: Scaling EC2 and EBS increases ops, and EBS is not for object storage.

### Question #115

A medical records company is hosting an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes customer data files that are stored on Amazon S3. The EC2 instances are hosted in public subnets. The EC2 instances access Amazon S3 over the internet, but they do not require any other network access. A new requirement mandates that the network trac for file transfers take a private route and not be sent over the internet. Which change to the network architecture should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

- A. Create a NAT gateway. Configure the route table for the public subnets to send trac to Amazon S3 through the NAT gateway.

- B. Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to restrict outbound trac so that only trac to the S3 prex list is permitted.

- C. Move the EC2 instances to private subnets. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, and link the endpoint to the route table for the private subnets.

- D. Remove the internet gateway from the VPC. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection, and route trac to Amazon S3 over the Direct Connect connection.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Move EC2 instances to private subnets and use an S3 gateway VPC endpoint for private S3 access without traversing the internet.

**Incorrect:**
- A: NAT gateways still traverse the internet for S3.
- B: Security groups don’t create private paths.
- D: Direct Connect is unnecessary and costly for this requirement.

- A. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

- B. Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)

- C. Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service)

- D. Amazon S3

**Correct:** D
**Why:** S3 scales virtually without limit and is the most cost-effective storage for a 900 TB text document repository.

**Incorrect:**
- A: EBS is block storage attached to EC2; not cost-effective at this scale.
- B: EFS is POSIX file storage and is more expensive for large, cold datasets.
- C: OpenSearch is a search/analytics engine, not bulk object storage.


---

---

### Question #121

A company is running an online transaction processing (OLTP) workload on AWS. This workload uses an unencrypted Amazon RDS DB instance in a Multi-AZ deployment. Daily database snapshots are taken from this instance. What should a solutions architect do to ensure the database and snapshots are always encrypted moving forward?

- A. Encrypt a copy of the latest DB snapshot. Replace existing DB instance by restoring the encrypted snapshot.

- B. Create a new encrypted Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume and copy the snapshots to it. Enable encryption on the DB instance.

- D. Copy the snapshots to an Amazon S3 bucket that is encrypted using server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) managed keys (SSE-KMS).

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Encrypt a copy of the latest snapshot and restore it to a new encrypted instance. All future snapshots of the encrypted DB will remain encrypted.

**Incorrect:**
- B: You cannot just copy snapshots to EBS volumes to enable RDS encryption.
- C: You cannot enable encryption on an existing unencrypted RDS instance; must restore from an encrypted snapshot.
- D: Copying to S3 with SSE-KMS does not encrypt the RDS DB instance or its native snapshots.

### Question #123

A company has a dynamic web application hosted on two Amazon EC2 instances. The company has its own SSL certicate, which is on each instance to perform SSL termination. There has been an increase in trac recently, and the operations team determined that SSL encryption and decryption is causing the compute capacity of the web servers to reach their maximum limit. What should a solutions architect do to increase the application's performance?

- A. Create a new SSL certicate using AWS Certicate Manager (ACM). Install the ACM certicate on each instance.

- B. Create an Amazon S3 bucket Migrate the SSL certicate to the S3 bucket. Configure the EC2 instances to reference the bucket for SSL termination.

- C. Create another EC2 instance as a proxy server. Migrate the SSL certicate to the new instance and configure it to direct connections to the existing EC2 instances.

- D. Import the SSL certicate into AWS Certicate Manager (ACM). Create an Application Load Balancer with an HTTPS listener that uses the SSL certicate from ACM.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Import the certificate into ACM and terminate TLS at an Application Load Balancer HTTPS listener to offload CPU from EC2.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Generating a new ACM cert ignores the existing valid cert; offloading is the key need.
- B: S3 is not used for SSL termination for EC2 apps.
- C: A proxy EC2 adds overhead and a single point of failure.

### Question #126

A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to reduce a company's storage costs. All the company's data is in the Amazon S3 Standard storage class. The company must keep all data for at least 25 years. Data from the most recent 2 years must be highly available and immediately retrievable. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive immediately.

- B. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.

- C. Use S3 Intelligent-Tiering. Activate the archiving option to ensure that data is archived in S3 Glacier Deep Archive.

- D. Set up an S3 Lifecycle policy to transition objects to S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) immediately and to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Keep last 2 years immediately accessible in S3 Standard; transition older objects to S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 2 years to minimize cost while meeting 25-year retention.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Immediate transition breaks the 2-year immediacy requirement (and S3 One Zone-IA reduces availability/HA).
- C: Intelligent-Tiering does not ensure Glacier Deep Archive placement on schedule nor minimal cost for very long-term archive.
- D: Immediate transition breaks the 2-year immediacy requirement (and S3 One Zone-IA reduces availability/HA).

### Question #227

A company needs to retain its AWS CloudTrail logs for 3 years. The company is enforcing CloudTrail across a set of AWS accounts by using AWS Organizations from the parent account. The CloudTrail target S3 bucket is congured with S3 Versioning enabled. An S3 Lifecycle policy is in place to delete current objects after 3 years. After the fourth year of use of the S3 bucket, the S3 bucket metrics show that the number of objects has continued to rise. However, the number of new CloudTrail logs that are delivered to the S3 bucket has remained consistent. Which solution will delete objects that are older than 3 years in the MOST cost-effective manner?

- A. Configure the organization’s centralized CloudTrail trail to expire objects after 3 years.

- B. Configure the S3 Lifecycle policy to delete previous versions as well as current versions.

- C. Create an AWS Lambda function to enumerate and delete objects from Amazon S3 that are older than 3 years.

### Question #18

An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

- B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

- C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.

- D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.

### Question #25

A company is designing an application. The application uses an AWS Lambda function to receive information through Amazon API Gateway and to store the information in an Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL database. During the proof-of-concept stage, the company has to increase the Lambda quotas signicantly to handle the high volumes of data that the company needs to load into the database. A solutions architect must recommend a new design to improve scalability and minimize the configuration effort. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Refactor the Lambda function code to Apache Tomcat code that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Connect the database by using native Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) drivers.

- B. Change the platform from Aurora to Amazon DynamoDProvision a DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) cluster. Use the DAX client SDK to point the existing DynamoDB API calls at the DAX cluster.

- C. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS).

- D. Set up two Lambda functions. Configure one function to receive the information. Configure the other function to load the information into the database. Integrate the Lambda functions by using an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Decouple ingestion and DB writes with SQS between two Lambdas; improves scalability and avoids throttling.

**Incorrect:**
- A: EC2 Tomcat increases ops.
- B: DynamoDB + DAX changes the persistence model.
- C: SNS lacks durable queueing and backpressure.

### Question #41

A company's application integrates with multiple software-as-a-service (SaaS) sources for data collection. The company runs Amazon EC2 instances to receive the data and to upload the data to an Amazon S3 bucket for analysis. The same EC2 instance that receives and uploads the data also sends a notification to the user when an upload is complete. The company has noticed slow application performance and wants to improve the performance as much as possible. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Create an Auto Scaling group so that EC2 instances can scale out. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

- B. Create an Amazon AppFlow flow to transfer data between each SaaS source and the S3 bucket. Configure an S3 event notification to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

- C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule for each SaaS source to send output data. Configure the S3 bucket as the rule's target. Create a second EventBridge (Cloud Watch Events) rule to send events when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete. Configure an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as the second rule's target.

- D. Create a Docker container to use instead of an EC2 instance. Host the containerized application on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). Configure Amazon CloudWatch Container Insights to send events to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when the upload to the S3 bucket is complete.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Amazon AppFlow ingests data from many SaaS apps directly to S3. S3 event to SNS notifies on upload; minimal ops.

**Incorrect:**
- A: EC2 ingestion adds scaling/ops.
- C: EventBridge/ECS are unnecessary here.
- D: EventBridge/ECS are unnecessary here.

### Question #45

A company has a data ingestion workow that consists of the following: • An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic for notications about new data deliveries • An AWS Lambda function to process the data and record metadata The company observes that the ingestion workow fails occasionally because of network connectivity issues. When such a failure occurs, the Lambda function does not ingest the corresponding data unless the company manually reruns the job. Which combination of actions should a solutions architect take to ensure that the Lambda function ingests all data in the future? (Choose two.)

- A. Deploy the Lambda function in multiple Availability Zones.

- B. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue, and subscribe it to the SNS topic.

- C. Increase the CPU and memory that are allocated to the Lambda function.

- D. Increase provisioned throughput for the Lambda function.

E. Modify the Lambda function to read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue.

**Correct:** B, E
**Why:** Fan out SNS to SQS for durability/retries; have Lambda consume SQS so transient failures are retried.

**Incorrect:**
- A: AZ placement/CPU/memory won’t fix delivery guarantees.
- C: AZ placement/CPU/memory won’t fix delivery guarantees.
- D: AZ placement/CPU/memory won’t fix delivery guarantees.

### Question #46

A company has an application that provides marketing services to stores. The services are based on previous purchases by store customers. The stores upload transaction data to the company through SFTP, and the data is processed and analyzed to generate new marketing offers. Some of the files can exceed 200 GB in size. Recently, the company discovered that some of the stores have uploaded files that contain personally identiable information (PII) that should not have been included. The company wants administrators to be alerted if PII is shared again. The company also wants to automate remediation. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements with the LEAST development effort?

- A. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Inspector to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the objects that contain PII.

- B. Use an Amazon S3 bucket as a secure transfer point. Use Amazon Macie to scan the objects in the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

- C. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to trigger a notification to the administrators to remove the objects that contain PII.

- D. Implement custom scanning algorithms in an AWS Lambda function. Trigger the function when objects are loaded into the bucket. If objects contain PII, use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to trigger a notification to the administrators and trigger an S3 Lifecycle policy to remove the meats that contain PII.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Amazon Macie automatically discovers PII in S3 and can alert via SNS/EventBridge; least dev effort. Remediation can be automated from the alert.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Inspector doesn’t scan S3 for PII.
- C: Custom PII detection is heavy dev; lifecycle cannot conditionally delete on PII.
- D: Custom PII detection is heavy dev; lifecycle cannot conditionally delete on PII.

Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure the application to send the data to Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose.

- B. Use Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to format the data and to send the report by email.

- C. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Glue job to query the application's API for the data.

- D. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) scheduled event that invokes an AWS Lambda function to query the application's API for the data.

E. Store the application data in Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic as an S3 event destination to send the report by email.

**Correct:** D, B
**Why:** Use an EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke a Lambda function that queries the API and formats an HTML report; use Amazon SES to send the emails on schedule.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Kinesis Data Firehose is for streaming delivery, not scheduled report generation from an API.
- C: AWS Glue is overkill and not intended to poll a REST API on a cron.
- E: S3 events trigger on S3 object changes, not on a schedule and not for building the report.

### Question #75

A company wants to move a multi-tiered application from on premises to the AWS Cloud to improve the application's performance. The application consists of application tiers that communicate with each other by way of RESTful services. Transactions are dropped when one tier becomes overloaded. A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues and modernizes the application. Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally ecient?

- A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services.

- B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.

- C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.

- D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Use SQS between EC2 tiers to decouple and buffer requests; scale with queue depth to prevent dropped transactions.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Full serverless refactor (API Gateway + Lambda) is larger change.
- B: Upsizing instances doesn’t address overload spikes and coupling.
- C: SNS is pub/sub, not a queue for backpressure and ordering.

### Question #164

A company has two applications: a sender application that sends messages with payloads to be processed and a processing application intended to receive the messages with payloads. The company wants to implement an AWS service to handle messages between the two applications. The sender application can send about 1,000 messages each hour. The messages may take up to 2 days to be processed: If the messages fail to process, they must be retained so that they do not impact the processing of any remaining messages. Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally ecient?

- A. Set up an Amazon EC2 instance running a Redis database. Configure both applications to use the instance. Store, process, and delete the messages, respectively.

- B. Use an Amazon Kinesis data stream to receive the messages from the sender application. Integrate the processing application with the Kinesis Client Library (KCL).

- C. Integrate the sender and processor applications with an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure a dead-letter queue to collect the messages that failed to process.

- D. Subscribe the processing application to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to receive notications to process. Integrate the sender application to write to the SNS topic.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** SQS decouples sender/processor, retains failed messages via DLQ, and supports 2‑day processing window.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Redis on EC2 adds ops and durability risk.
- B: Kinesis is streaming; SQS fits work queue semantics.
- D: SNS fanout is pub/sub, not durable work queue.

### Question #181

A company has a legacy data processing application that runs on Amazon EC2 instances. Data is processed sequentially, but the order of results does not matter. The application uses a monolithic architecture. The only way that the company can scale the application to meet increased demand is to increase the size of the instances. The company’s developers have decided to rewrite the application to use a microservices architecture on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS). What should a solutions architect recommend for communication between the microservices?

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Add code to the data producers, and send data to the queue. Add code to the data consumers to process data from the queue.

- B. Create an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Add code to the data producers, and publish notications to the topic. Add code to the data consumers to subscribe to the topic.

- C. Create an AWS Lambda function to pass messages. Add code to the data producers to call the Lambda function with a data object. Add code to the data consumers to receive a data object that is passed from the Lambda function.

- D. Create an Amazon DynamoDB table. Enable DynamoDB Streams. Add code to the data producers to insert data into the table. Add code to the data consumers to use the DynamoDB Streams API to detect new table entries and retrieve the data.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** SQS decouples producers/consumers; order of results irrelevant; scales with ECS microservices.

**Incorrect:**
- B: SNS pub/sub not a work queue.
- C: Lambda relay/DynamoDB streams add complexity.
- D: Lambda relay/DynamoDB streams add complexity.

### Question #228

A company has an API that receives real-time data from a eet of monitoring devices. The API stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the monitoring devices send to the API uctuates. During periods of heavy trac, the API often returns timeout errors. After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of processing the volume of write trac that comes from the API. A solutions architect must minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy trac. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Increase the size of the DB instance to an instance type that has more available memory.

- B. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ DB instance. Configure the application to write to all active RDS DB instances.

- C. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SQS invokes to write data from the queue to the database.

- D. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SNS invokes to write data from the topic to the database.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Buffer writes to SQS; Lambda consumer batches and reduces DB connection pressure and failed timeouts.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Upsizing doesn’t solve connection storms.
- B: Multi‑AZ doesn’t increase write throughput.
- D: SNS is pub/sub, not a durable write buffer.

### Question #18

An application development team is designing a microservice that will convert large images to smaller, compressed images. When a user uploads an image through the web interface, the microservice should store the image in an Amazon S3 bucket, process and compress the image with an AWS Lambda function, and store the image in its compressed form in a different S3 bucket. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that uses durable, stateless components to process the images automatically. Which combination of actions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

- B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

- C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.

- D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.

### Question #40

A company has thousands of edge devices that collectively generate 1 TB of status alerts each day. Each alert is approximately 2 KB in size. A solutions architect needs to implement a solution to ingest and store the alerts for future analysis. The company wants a highly available solution. However, the company needs to minimize costs and does not want to manage additional infrastructure. Additionally, the company wants to keep 14 days of data available for immediate analysis and archive any data older than 14 days. What is the MOST operationally ecient solution that meets these requirements?

- A. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.

- B. Launch Amazon EC2 instances across two Availability Zones and place them behind an Elastic Load Balancer to ingest the alerts. Create a script on the EC2 instances that will store the alerts in an Amazon S3 bucket. Set up an S3 Lifecycle configuration to transition data to Amazon S3 Glacier after 14 days.

- C. Create an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to ingest the alerts. Configure the Kinesis Data Firehose stream to deliver the alerts to an Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster. Set up the Amazon OpenSearch Service (Amazon Elasticsearch Service) cluster to take manual snapshots every day and delete data from the cluster that is older than 14 days.

- D. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue to ingest the alerts, and set the message retention period to 14 days. Configure consumers to poll the SQS queue, check the age of the message, and analyze the message data as needed. If the message is 14 days old, the consumer should copy the message to an Amazon S3 bucket and delete the message from the SQS queue.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Firehose→S3 is fully managed and HA. S3 Lifecycle transitions to Glacier after 14 days for cost control.

**Incorrect:**
- B: EC2+ELB adds ops.

### Question #67

A company hosts an application on multiple Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes messages from an Amazon SQS queue, writes to an Amazon RDS table, and deletes the message from the queue. Occasional duplicate records are found in the RDS table. The SQS queue does not contain any duplicate messages. What should a solutions architect do to ensure messages are being processed once only?

- A. Use the CreateQueue API call to create a new queue.

- B. Use the AddPermission API call to add appropriate permissions.

- C. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to set an appropriate wait time.

- D. Use the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** If processing takes longer than the visibility timeout, messages reappear and cause duplicates; increase visibility timeout appropriately.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Queue creation/permissions don’t address duplicates.
- B: Queue creation/permissions don’t address duplicates.
- C: Long polling reduces empty receives, not duplicates.

A solutions architect must design a solution that resolves these issues and modernizes the application. Which solution meets these requirements and is the MOST operationally ecient?

- A. Use Amazon API Gateway and direct transactions to the AWS Lambda functions as the application layer. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) as the communication layer between application services.

- B. Use Amazon CloudWatch metrics to analyze the application performance history to determine the servers' peak utilization during the performance failures. Increase the size of the application server's Amazon EC2 instances to meet the peak requirements.

- C. Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SNS queue length and scale up and down as required.

- D. Use Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) to handle the messaging between application servers running on Amazon EC2 in an Auto Scaling group. Use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the SQS queue length and scale up when communication failures are detected.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Use SQS between EC2 tiers to decouple and buffer requests; scale with queue depth to prevent dropped transactions.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Full serverless refactor (API Gateway + Lambda) is larger change.
- B: Upsizing instances doesn’t address overload spikes and coupling.
- C: SNS is pub/sub, not a queue for backpressure and ordering.

### Question #87

A company hosts an application on AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by an Amazon API Gateway API. The Lambda functions save customer data to an Amazon Aurora MySQL database. Whenever the company upgrades the database, the Lambda functions fail to establish database connections until the upgrade is complete. The result is that customer data is not recorded for some of the event. A solutions architect needs to design a solution that stores customer data that is created during database upgrades. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Provision an Amazon RDS proxy to sit between the Lambda functions and the database. Configure the Lambda functions to connect to the RDS proxy.

- B. Increase the run time of the Lambda functions to the maximum. Create a retry mechanism in the code that stores the customer data in the database.

- C. Persist the customer data to Lambda local storage. Configure new Lambda functions to scan the local storage to save the customer data to the database.

- D. Store the customer data in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue. Create a new Lambda function that polls the queue and stores the customer data in the database.

**Why:** Queue customer events in SQS FIFO during DB upgrades; a separate Lambda polls the queue and writes when DB is available so no data is lost.

**Incorrect:**
- A: RDS Proxy helps with connection pooling but cannot accept writes during DB unavailability.
- B: Extending Lambda run time and retries still loses events when the DB is down.
- C: Lambda local storage is ephemeral and not durable.

### Question #98

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email. Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.

- B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.

- C. Increase the visibility timeout in the SQS queue to a value that is greater than the total of the function timeout and the batch window timeout.

- D. Modify the Lambda function to delete each message from the SQS queue immediately after the message is read before processing.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** With SQS standard + Lambda, ensure the visibility timeout exceeds the function processing time (and batch window) to avoid reprocessing and duplicate emails.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Long polling doesn’t prevent duplicate deliveries.
- B: Converting to FIFO may reduce dupes but adds ordering/dedup constraints and is unnecessary; visibility is the core fix.
- D: Deleting immediately risks data loss on processing failure and is not the intended flow.

### Question #108

A company has an automobile sales website that stores its listings in a database on Amazon RDS. When an automobile is sold, the listing needs to be removed from the website and the data must be sent to multiple target systems. Which design should a solutions architect recommend?

- A. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue for the targets to consume.

- B. Create an AWS Lambda function triggered when the database on Amazon RDS is updated to send the information to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) FIFO queue for the targets to consume.

- C. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topics. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

- D. Subscribe to an RDS event notification and send an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic fanned out to multiple Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queues. Use AWS Lambda functions to update the targets.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Use RDS event notifications to an SNS topic, fan out to multiple SQS queues, and use Lambda functions to update each target. This provides decoupling and fan-out.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Lambda cannot be triggered directly by row-level RDS updates. FIFO also does not fix that limitation.
- B: Lambda cannot be triggered directly by row-level RDS updates. FIFO also does not fix that limitation.
- C: The SQS->SNS fan-out order is reversed.

### Question #148

A company has a data ingestion workow that includes the following components: An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic that receives notications about new data deliveries An AWS Lambda function that processes and stores the data The ingestion workow occasionally fails because of network connectivity issues. When failure occurs, the corresponding data is not ingested unless the company manually reruns the job. What should a solutions architect do to ensure that all notications are eventually processed?

- A. Configure the Lambda function for deployment across multiple Availability Zones.

- B. Modify the Lambda function's configuration to increase the CPU and memory allocations for the function.

- C. Configure the SNS topic’s retry strategy to increase both the number of retries and the wait time between retries.

- D. Configure an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the on-failure destination. Modify the Lambda function to process messages in the queue.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Configure an SQS queue as an on-failure destination so failed notifications are retained. Modify processing to consume and reprocess from the queue to ensure eventual processing.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Multi-AZ Lambda has no meaning; Lambda is managed and highly available already.
- B: More CPU/memory does not fix transient network failures.
- C: Increasing SNS retry helps but still can fail; DLQ ensures durability.

### Question #228

A company has an API that receives real-time data from a eet of monitoring devices. The API stores this data in an Amazon RDS DB instance for later analysis. The amount of data that the monitoring devices send to the API uctuates. During periods of heavy trac, the API often returns timeout errors. After an inspection of the logs, the company determines that the database is not capable of processing the volume of write trac that comes from the API. A solutions architect must minimize the number of connections to the database and must ensure that data is not lost during periods of heavy trac. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Increase the size of the DB instance to an instance type that has more available memory.

- B. Modify the DB instance to be a Multi-AZ DB instance. Configure the application to write to all active RDS DB instances.

- D. Modify the API to write incoming data to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic. Use an AWS Lambda function that Amazon SNS invokes to write data from the topic to the database.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Buffer writes to SQS; Lambda consumer batches and reduces DB connection pressure and failed timeouts.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Upsizing doesn’t solve connection storms.
- B: Multi‑AZ doesn’t increase write throughput.
- D: SNS is pub/sub, not a durable write buffer.

### Question #37

A company recently launched a variety of new workloads on Amazon EC2 instances in its AWS account. The company needs to create a strategy to access and administer the instances remotely and securely. The company needs to implement a repeatable process that works with native AWS services and follows the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Use the EC2 serial console to directly access the terminal interface of each instance for administration.

- B. Attach the appropriate IAM role to each existing instance and new instance. Use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager to establish a remote SSH session.

- C. Create an administrative SSH key pair. Load the public key into each EC2 instance. Deploy a bastion host in a public subnet to provide a tunnel for administration of each instance.

- D. Establish an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection. Instruct administrators to use their local on-premises machines to connect directly to the instances by using SSH keys across the VPN tunnel.

**Correct:** B
**Why:** Systems Manager Session Manager with instance IAM roles provides secure, auditable access without SSH keys/bastions.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Serial console is break-glass, not day‑to‑day access.
- C: Bastions/VPN+SSH increase ops and key mgmt.
- D: Bastions/VPN+SSH increase ops and key mgmt.

### Question #55

A solutions architect is developing a VPC architecture that includes multiple subnets. The architecture will host applications that use Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon RDS DB instances. The architecture consists of six subnets in two Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone includes a public subnet, a private subnet, and a dedicated subnet for databases. Only EC2 instances that run in the private subnets can have access to the RDS databases. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Create a new route table that excludes the route to the public subnets' CIDR blocks. Associate the route table with the database subnets.

- B. Create a security group that denies inbound trac from the security group that is assigned to instances in the public subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.

- C. Create a security group that allows inbound trac from the security group that is assigned to instances in the private subnets. Attach the security group to the DB instances.

- D. Create a new peering connection between the public subnets and the private subnets. Create a different peering connection between the private subnets and the database subnets.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Use security groups to allow inbound to the DB from the security group attached to private-tier EC2 only; least privilege and simple.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Route tables do not enforce security at instance level.
- B: Security groups are allow lists; “deny” rules are not supported.
- D: VPC peering within the same VPC is not a thing and peering is unnecessary.

### Question #73

A company recently launched Linux-based application instances on Amazon EC2 in a private subnet and launched a Linux-based bastion host on an Amazon EC2 instance in a public subnet of a VPC. A solutions architect needs to connect from the on-premises network, through the company's internet connection, to the bastion host, and to the application servers. The solutions architect must make sure that the security groups of all the EC2 instances will allow that access. Which combination of steps should the solutions architect take to meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the application instances.

- B. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the internal IP range for the company.

- C. Replace the current security group of the bastion host with one that only allows inbound access from the external IP range for the company.

- D. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the private IP address of the bastion host.

E. Replace the current security group of the application instances with one that allows inbound SSH access from only the public IP address of the bastion host.

**Correct:** C, D
**Why:** Allow inbound SSH to the bastion from the company’s external public IP range; on the private instances, allow inbound SSH only from the bastion’s private IP.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Bastion must accept admin traffic from on-prem, not from app servers.
- B: Internal IP range won’t reach the bastion over the Internet.
- E: Using the bastion’s public IP to reach private instances bypasses the private network path.

### Question #91

A company has applications that run on Amazon EC2 instances in a VPC. One of the applications needs to call the Amazon S3 API to store and read objects. According to the company's security regulations, no trac from the applications is allowed to travel across the internet. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Configure an S3 gateway endpoint.

- B. Create an S3 bucket in a private subnet.

- C. Create an S3 bucket in the same AWS Region as the EC2 instances.

- D. Configure a NAT gateway in the same subnet as the EC2 instances.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** An S3 gateway endpoint provides private connectivity from the VPC to S3 without traversing the Internet.

**Incorrect:**
- B: S3 buckets are global service endpoints, not deployed in subnets.
- C: Same Region does not imply private routing.
- D: NAT still uses the Internet path.


---

---

### Question #92

A company is storing sensitive user information in an Amazon S3 bucket. The company wants to provide secure access to this bucket from the application tier running on Amazon EC2 instances inside a VPC. Which combination of steps should a solutions architect take to accomplish this? (Choose two.)

- A. Configure a VPC gateway endpoint for Amazon S3 within the VPC.

- B. Create a bucket policy to make the objects in the S3 bucket public.

- D. Create an IAM user with an S3 access policy and copy the IAM credentials to the EC2 instance.

E. Create a NAT instance and have the EC2 instances use the NAT instance to access the S3 bucket.

**Correct:** A, C
**Why:** Use an S3 gateway endpoint for private access; restrict bucket policy to the VPC/application tier so only those resources can access.

**Incorrect:**
- B: Public objects violate security.
- D: Copying user credentials to instances is insecure.
- E: NAT uses the Internet path and is unnecessary with an endpoint.


---

---

### Question #101

A solutions architect is designing a VPC with public and private subnets. The VPC and subnets use IPv4 CIDR blocks. There is one public subnet and one private subnet in each of three Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability. An internet gateway is used to provide internet access for the public subnets. The private subnets require access to the internet to allow Amazon EC2 instances to download software updates. What should the solutions architect do to enable Internet access for the private subnets?

- A. Create three NAT gateways, one for each public subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC trac to the NAT gateway in its AZ.

- B. Create three NAT instances, one for each private subnet in each AZ. Create a private route table for each AZ that forwards non-VPC trac to the NAT instance in its AZ.

- C. Create a second internet gateway on one of the private subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC trac to the private internet gateway.

- D. Create an egress-only internet gateway on one of the public subnets. Update the route table for the private subnets that forward non-VPC trac to the egress-only Internet gateway.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Private subnets with IPv4 require a NAT device in a public subnet to reach the internet. Creating one NAT gateway per AZ and routing private subnet traffic in that AZ to its NAT gateway provides high availability and zone-local egress.

**Incorrect:**
- B: NAT instances are legacy, require manual management, and must be in public subnets. Also, creating one per private subnet is unnecessary and less available.
- C: You cannot attach an internet gateway to a subnet. IGWs attach to the VPC and do not make private subnets public.
- D: Egress-only internet gateways are for IPv6 only. The VPC uses IPv4.

### Question #104

A solutions architect must design a highly available infrastructure for a website. The website is powered by Windows web servers that run on Amazon EC2 instances. The solutions architect must implement a solution that can mitigate a large-scale DDoS attack that originates from thousands of IP addresses. Downtime is not acceptable for the website. Which actions should the solutions architect take to protect the website from such an attack? (Choose two.)

- A. Use AWS Shield Advanced to stop the DDoS attack.

- B. Configure Amazon GuardDuty to automatically block the attackers.

- C. Configure the website to use Amazon CloudFront for both static and dynamic content.

- D. Use an AWS Lambda function to automatically add attacker IP addresses to VPC network ACLs.

E. Use EC2 Spot Instances in an Auto Scaling group with a target tracking scaling policy that is set to 80% CPU utilization.

**Correct:** A, C
**Why:** AWS Shield Advanced provides advanced DDoS protection. CloudFront absorbs and isolates traffic at edge locations and can protect dynamic and static content.

**Incorrect:**
- B: GuardDuty detects threats; it does not automatically block DDoS attacks.
- D: Automatically inserting attacker IPs into NACLs is brittle and not scalable for large DDoS campaigns.
- E: Spot Instances do not mitigate DDoS.

### Question #115

A medical records company is hosting an application on Amazon EC2 instances. The application processes customer data files that are stored on Amazon S3. The EC2 instances are hosted in public subnets. The EC2 instances access Amazon S3 over the internet, but they do not require any other network access. A new requirement mandates that the network trac for file transfers take a private route and not be sent over the internet. Which change to the network architecture should a solutions architect recommend to meet this requirement?

- A. Create a NAT gateway. Configure the route table for the public subnets to send trac to Amazon S3 through the NAT gateway.

- B. Configure the security group for the EC2 instances to restrict outbound trac so that only trac to the S3 prex list is permitted.

- C. Move the EC2 instances to private subnets. Create a VPC endpoint for Amazon S3, and link the endpoint to the route table for the private subnets.

- D. Remove the internet gateway from the VPC. Set up an AWS Direct Connect connection, and route trac to Amazon S3 over the Direct Connect connection.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Move EC2 instances to private subnets and use an S3 gateway VPC endpoint for private S3 access without traversing the internet.

**Incorrect:**
- A: NAT gateways still traverse the internet for S3.
- B: Security groups don’t create private paths.
- D: Direct Connect is unnecessary and costly for this requirement.

---

### Question #125

A company runs its two-tier ecommerce website on AWS. The web tier consists of a load balancer that sends trac to Amazon EC2 instances. The database tier uses an Amazon RDS DB instance. The EC2 instances and the RDS DB instance should not be exposed to the public internet. The EC2 instances require internet access to complete payment processing of orders through a third-party web service. The application must be highly available. Which combination of configuration options will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in private subnets. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.

- B. Configure a VPC with two private subnets and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the private subnets.

- C. Use an Auto Scaling group to launch the EC2 instances in public subnets across two Availability Zones. Deploy an RDS Multi-AZ DB instance in private subnets.

- D. Configure a VPC with one public subnet, one private subnet, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnet. Configure a VPC with two public subnets, two private subnets, and two NAT gateways across two Availability Zones. Deploy an Application Load Balancer in the public subnets.

**Correct:** A, D
**Why:** Place EC2 instances and RDS in private subnets. Use a public ALB in public subnets for inbound traffic and NAT gateways across AZs for EC2 egress to third-party services.

**Incorrect:**
- B: An ALB cannot be placed only in private subnets for internet-facing traffic; also missing public subnets for internet ingress.
- C: EC2 in public subnets is prohibited by the requirement.

---

### Question #135

A company runs workloads on AWS. The company needs to connect to a service from an external provider. The service is hosted in the provider's VPC. According to the company’s security team, the connectivity must be private and must be restricted to the target service. The connection must be initiated only from the company’s VPC. Which solution will mast these requirements?

- A. Create a VPC peering connection between the company's VPC and the provider's VPC. Update the route table to connect to the target service.

- B. Ask the provider to create a virtual private gateway in its VPC. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.

- C. Create a NAT gateway in a public subnet of the company’s VPUpdate the route table to connect to the target service.

- D. Ask the provider to create a VPC endpoint for the target service. Use AWS PrivateLink to connect to the target service.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** With AWS PrivateLink, the provider exposes the service via a VPC endpoint service (backed by an NLB). The company (consumer) connects through an interface endpoint to that specific service, private and restricted.

**Incorrect:**
- A: VPC peering is broad and not restricted to a specific service.
- B: A virtual private gateway is for VPNs, not PrivateLink.
- C: NAT gateway sends traffic to the internet, not a private provider service.

### Question #151

A company wants to migrate its on-premises data center to AWS. According to the company's compliance requirements, the company can use only the ap-northeast-3 Region. Company administrators are not permitted to connect VPCs to the internet. Which solutions will meet these requirements? (Choose two.)

- A. Use AWS Control Tower to implement data residency guardrails to deny internet access and deny access to all AWS Regions except ap- northeast-3.

- B. Use rules in AWS WAF to prevent internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3 in the AWS account settings.

- C. Use AWS Organizations to configure service control policies (SCPS) that prevent VPCs from gaining internet access. Deny access to all AWS Regions except ap-northeast-3.

- D. Create an outbound rule for the network ACL in each VPC to deny all trac from 0.0.0.0/0. Create an IAM policy for each user to prevent the use of any AWS Region other than ap-northeast-3.

E. Use AWS Cong to activate managed rules to detect and alert for internet gateways and to detect and alert for new resources deployed outside of ap-northeast-3.

**Correct:** A, C
**Why:** Use organization-wide guardrails. AWS Control Tower guardrails or Organizations SCPs can enforce data residency (Region allow list) and deny internet access (e.g., prevent IGWs/NATs). This meets compliance and prevents admins from attaching internet egress.

**Incorrect:**
- B: WAF protects web apps, not VPC egress. Account settings cannot globally deny Regions.
- D: NACL rules are per-subnet and error‑prone; IAM policies don’t restrict Region usage account-wide.
- E: AWS Config detects and alerts; it does not enforce.

**Why:** Encrypt at rest with KMS for EBS and Aurora; attach ACM cert to ALB for TLS in transit.

**Incorrect:**
- A: KMS provides key mgmt; ACM is for certs, not EBS/Aurora encryption.
- B: Root account toggles and BitLocker are not appropriate in AWS.
- D: Root account toggles and BitLocker are not appropriate in AWS.

### Question #244

A company is using a content management system that runs on a single Amazon EC2 instance. The EC2 instance contains both the web server and the database software. The company must make its website platform highly available and must enable the website to scale to meet user demand. What should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Move the database to Amazon RDS, and enable automatic backups. Manually launch another EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone. Configure an Application Load Balancer in the Availability Zone, and set the two instances as targets.

- B. Migrate the database to an Amazon Aurora instance with a read replica in the same Availability Zone as the existing EC2 instance. Manually launch another EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone. Configure an Application Load Balancer, and set the two EC2 instances as targets.

- C. Move the database to Amazon Aurora with a read replica in another Availability Zone. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load Balancer in two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two Availability Zones.

- D. Move the database to a separate EC2 instance, and schedule backups to Amazon S3. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the original EC2 instance. Configure an Application Load Balancer in two Availability Zones. Attach an Auto Scaling group that uses the AMI across two Availability Zones.

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Aurora with a read replica across AZs for DB, ALB + Auto Scaling across two AZs using AMI provides HA and scalability.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Single‑AZ parts or EC2 DB increase risk/ops.
- B: Single‑AZ parts or EC2 DB increase risk/ops.
- D: Single‑AZ parts or EC2 DB increase risk/ops.

### Question #245

A company is launching an application on AWS. The application uses an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to direct trac to at least two Amazon EC2 instances in a single target group. The instances are in an Auto Scaling group for each environment. The company requires a development environment and a production environment. The production environment will have periods of high trac. Which solution will configure the development environment MOST cost-effectively?

- A. Recongure the target group in the development environment to have only one EC2 instance as a target.

- B. Change the ALB balancing algorithm to least outstanding requests.

- C. Reduce the size of the EC2 instances in both environments.

- D. Reduce the maximum number of EC2 instances in the development environment’s Auto Scaling group.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Lower the max for dev Auto Scaling to cut cost; production can scale for peaks.

**Incorrect:**
- A: One target may impact HA testing but savings possible; D is cleaner.
- B: Don’t specifically address dev cost constraints.
- C: Don’t specifically address dev cost constraints.

### Question #246

A company runs a web application on Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The EC2 instances are in private subnets. A solutions architect implements an internet-facing Application Load Balancer (ALB) and species the EC2 instances as the target group. However, the internet trac is not reaching the EC2 instances. How should the solutions architect recongure the architecture to resolve this issue?

- A. Replace the ALB with a Network Load Balancer. Configure a NAT gateway in a public subnet to allow internet trac.

- B. Move the EC2 instances to public subnets. Add a rule to the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound trac to 0.0.0.0/0.

- C. Update the route tables for the EC2 instances’ subnets to send 0.0.0.0/0 trac through the internet gateway route. Add a rule to the EC2 instances’ security groups to allow outbound trac to 0.0.0.0/0.

- D. Create public subnets in each Availability Zone. Associate the public subnets with the ALB. Update the route tables for the public subnets with a route to the private subnets.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Internet‑facing ALB must be in public subnets; it can target instances in private subnets over routable paths.

**Incorrect:**
- A: NAT/IGW or moving instances public is not required.
- B: NAT/IGW or moving instances public is not required.
- C: NAT/IGW or moving instances public is not required.

### Question #248

A company runs analytics software on Amazon EC2 instances. The software accepts job requests from users to process data that has been uploaded to Amazon S3. Users report that some submitted data is not being processed Amazon CloudWatch reveals that the EC2 instances have a consistent CPU utilization at or near 100%. The company wants to improve system performance and scale the system based on user load. What should a solutions architect do to meet these requirements?

- A. Create a copy of the instance. Place all instances behind an Application Load Balancer.

- B. Create an S3 VPC endpoint for Amazon S3. Update the software to reference the endpoint.

- C. Stop the EC2 instances. Modify the instance type to one with a more powerful CPU and more memory. Restart the instances.

- D. Route incoming requests to Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS). Configure an EC2 Auto Scaling group based on queue size. Update the software to read from the queue.

**Correct:** D
**Why:** Queueing with SQS and Auto Scaling based on queue size decouples workload and scales processing elastically.

**Incorrect:**
- A: Load balancer doesn’t solve CPU saturation.
- B: S3 VPC endpoint not relevant.
- C: Bigger instances alone won’t handle spikes efficiently.

## General / Architecture

### Question #222

A company has hired an external vendor to perform work in the company’s AWS account. The vendor uses an automated tool that is hosted in an AWS account that the vendor owns. The vendor does not have IAM access to the company’s AWS account. How should a solutions architect grant this access to the vendor?

- A. Create an IAM role in the company’s account to delegate access to the vendor’s IAM role. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the role for the permissions that the vendor requires.

- B. Create an IAM user in the company’s account with a password that meets the password complexity requirements. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the user for the permissions that the vendor requires.

- C. Create an IAM group in the company’s account. Add the tool’s IAM user from the vendor account to the group. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the group for the permissions that the vendor requires.

- D. Create a new identity provider by choosing “AWS account” as the provider type in the IAM console. Supply the vendor’s AWS account ID and user name. Attach the appropriate IAM policies to the new provider for the permissions that the vendor requires.

**Correct:** A
**Why:** Cross‑account role assumption is the secure, least‑privilege pattern for vendor automation.

**Incorrect:**
- B: User credentials are less secure and harder to manage.
- C: IAM groups or identity provider setup as described are incorrect here.
- D: IAM groups or identity provider setup as described are incorrect here.
