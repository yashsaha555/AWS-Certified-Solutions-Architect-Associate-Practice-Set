### Question #253

A solutions architect has created two IAM policies: Policy1 and Policy2. Both policies are attached to an IAM group. A cloud engineer is added as an IAM user to the IAM group. The policy documents are:

Policy 1
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Allow",
			"Action": [
				"iam:Get*",
				"iam:List*",
				"kms:List*",
				"ec2:*",
				"ds:*",
				"logs:Get*",
				"logs:Describe*"
			],
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}

Policy 2
{
	"Version": "2012-10-17",
	"Statement": [
		{
			"Effect": "Deny",
			"Action": "ds:Delete*",
			"Resource": "*"
		}
	]
}

Which action will the cloud engineer be able to perform?

- A. Deleting IAM users

- B. Deleting directories

- C. Deleting Amazon EC2 instances

- D. Deleting logs from Amazon CloudWatch Logs

**Correct:** C
**Why:** Policy 1 explicitly allows ec2:* so terminating/deleting EC2 instances is allowed. Policy 2 adds an explicit Deny only for ds:Delete*, which overrides ds:* but does not affect EC2. Deleting IAM users and CloudWatch Logs are not covered by the allowed actions (only iam:Get*/List* and logs:Get*/Describe* are allowed).

### Question #98

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email. Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.

- B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.

During a recent sales event, a sudden surge in customer orders occurred. Some customers experienced timeouts, and the application did not process the orders of those customers. A solutions architect determined that the CPU utilization and memory utilization were high on the database because of a large number of open connections. The solutions architect needs to prevent the timeout errors while making the least possible changes to the application. Which solution will meet these requirements?

- A. Configure provisioned concurrency for the Lambda function. Modify the database to be a global database in multiple AWS Regions.

- B. Use Amazon RDS Proxy to create a proxy for the database. Modify the Lambda function to use the RDS Proxy endpoint instead of the database endpoint.

- C. Create a read replica for the database in a different AWS Region. Use query string parameters in API Gateway to route trac to the read replica.

- D. Migrate the data from Aurora PostgreSQL to Amazon DynamoDB by using AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS). Modify the Lambda function to use the DynamoDB table.

**Correct:** B

- A. Create an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Configure the S3 bucket to send a notification to the SQS queue when an image is uploaded to the S3 bucket.

- B. Configure the Lambda function to use the Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue as the invocation source. When the SQS message is successfully processed, delete the message in the queue.

- C. Configure the Lambda function to monitor the S3 bucket for new uploads. When an uploaded image is detected, write the file name to a text file in memory and use the text file to keep track of the images that were processed.

- D. Launch an Amazon EC2 instance to monitor an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. When items are added to the queue, log the file name in a text file on the EC2 instance and invoke the Lambda function.

E. Configure an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) event to monitor the S3 bucket. When an image is uploaded, send an alert to an Amazon ample Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic with the application owner's email address for further processing.

**Correct:** A, B

**Correct:** C
**Why:** S3 events to SQS with a Lambda consumer scales elastically and processes quickly after upload, with durable buffering for bursts.

---

### Question #98

An image-processing company has a web application that users use to upload images. The application uploads the images into an Amazon S3 bucket. The company has set up S3 event notications to publish the object creation events to an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) standard queue. The SQS queue serves as the event source for an AWS Lambda function that processes the images and sends the results to users through email. Users report that they are receiving multiple email messages for every uploaded image. A solutions architect determines that SQS messages are invoking the Lambda function more than once, resulting in multiple email messages. What should the solutions architect do to resolve this issue with the LEAST operational overhead?

- A. Set up long polling in the SQS queue by increasing the ReceiveMessage wait time to 30 seconds.

- B. Change the SQS standard queue to an SQS FIFO queue. Use the message deduplication ID to discard duplicate messages.

### Question #422

A company is developing a new machine learning (ML) model solution on AWS. The models are developed as independent microservices that fetch approximately 1 GB of model data from Amazon S3 at startup and load the data into memory. Users access the models through an asynchronous API. Users can send a request or a batch of requests and specify where the results should be sent. The company provides models to hundreds of users. The usage patterns for the models are irregular. Some models could be unused for days or weeks. Other models could receive batches of thousands of requests at a time. Which design should a solutions architect recommend to meet these requirements?

- A. Direct the requests from the API to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by the NLB.

- B. Direct the requests from the API to an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Use AWS App Mesh to scale the instances of the ECS cluster based on the SQS queue size.

- C. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as AWS Lambda functions that are invoked by SQS events. Use AWS Auto Scaling to increase the number of vCPUs for the Lambda functions based on the SQS queue size.

- D. Direct the requests from the API into an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Deploy the models as Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) services that read from the queue. Enable AWS Auto Scaling on Amazon ECS for both the cluster and copies of the service based on the queue size.
